# rSpawn
## What is rSpawn?
rSpawn gives every player their own spawn point within a certain region (definable in config file).
This is helpful on survival maps, especially mine (which is why this plugin was created).
Additionally, specific biomes can be disabled if you do not want the player to spawn in them.

## How?
rSpawn depends on Multiverse Inventories in order to manage which worlds it will be enabled on.
It then uses a custom sharable to give each player their own unique spawn point.
